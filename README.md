# LineageOS Installation Instructions 
# For Samsung Galaxy S II (i9100)

## Introduction
The Samsung Galaxy S II was launched in May 2011. The latest firmware was based on Android 4.1.2 JellyBean and was last released in 2014. Since then, Samsung has discontinued support for the Galaxy S II.

Who did **not** discontinue the Android support was and is the community.

The largest Android community effort today is represented by [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/).

LineageOS is a free and open-source operating system for smartphones, tablet computers, and set-top boxes, based on the Android mobile platform. It is the successor to the custom ROM [CyanogenMod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod), from which it was forked in December 2016 when Cyanogen Inc. announced it was discontinuing development and shut down the infrastructure behind the project.

## Problems with similar guides
At the time of writing, it is rather difficult to flash Lineage on the Galaxy S II, the problems being:
- the Samsung Galaxy S II is no longer actively maintained by the LineageOS team;
- it is really difficult to find an updated guide;
- even when a valid guide is found, some (or all!) of the files to download are no longer available.

All of these problems are to be expected, considering how old this device is.

## Purpose of this guide
This project aims to solve at least two of these problems by providing a [detailed guide](Instructions.md) as well as [all the files](./bin) needed for flashing LineageOS on your Samsung Galaxy S II.

## Notes
This guide assumes that an original Samsung firmware Android 4.1.2 is installed on your Galaxy S II; however, it should work even If you have already installed a Custom Rom. For instance, I followed this guide using a Galaxy S II with CyanogenMod preinstalled, and it worked perfectly.
